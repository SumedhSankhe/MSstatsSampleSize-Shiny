# Import Data  

Begin by importing your dataset from the Import Data submenu in the sidebar.  
Input data must have:  
1. Preliminary data file: must be a .csv file in a “wide” format. Rows are 
proteins, columns are Biological replicates or samples, cells are protein 
abundances. Here is an example preliminary data file (Add a file link here):
  
<img src = ab.PNG width = "550" height = "300">

2. Annotation file: must be a .csv file in a “long” format. It includes columns
BioReplicate for sample ID and Condition for group information. BioReplicate 
information should be the same as the column names of Preliminary data. Here is 
an example annotation file  

<img src = an.PNG width = "200" height = "575">
